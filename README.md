# Bamazon
The bamazonCustomer.js allows customers to purchase the listed products selecting them by their name.

If you select a product from the list, the app will ask you how many would you like to buy:

If the purchased amount is in stock, the app will allow you to take from stock and tell you your purchase was successful
If the purchased amount exceeds the total in stock, the app will tell you there isn't enough in stock and you will have to start again.

The bamasonManager.js allows users to manage the store.
If you select View Products for Sale, the app will show all items available.

If you select View Low Inventory, the app will show only items with quantity below 5 units.

If you select Add to Inventory, the app will allow you to update an item quantity by choosing its name and entering a quantity.

If you select Add New Product, the app will prompt you to add a new product by name, department, price and quantity.
